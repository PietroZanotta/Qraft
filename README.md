## Abstract:

Current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers are useful in developing the quantum computing stack, test quantum algorithms, and establish the feasibility of quantum computing. However, different statistically significant errors permeate NISQ computers. To reduce the effect of these errors, recent research has focused on effective mapping of a quantum algorithm to a quantum computer in an error-and-constraints-aware manner. We propose the first work, QRAFT, to leverage the reversibility property of quantum algorithms to considerably reduce the error beyond the reduction achieved by effective circuit mapping.
